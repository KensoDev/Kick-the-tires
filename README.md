# Kicking the tires

## Overview
Kicking the tires is meant to be an open source test/exam for Ruby/Rails developers.

The idea came after many discussions and from the deep understanding that testing a developer/engineer on a whiteboard or with pen & paper simply doesn't work.

So, this is meant to be a take-home exam.


### Example
* [Advanced] Create a permission system where a user can/cannot do something without using any gems
* [Beginner] Create a form that will update the user details without using a scaffold

Each question will be tagged with the level you think is appropriate.

## Contributing
As you can see, this project is only a README file, the README file will be the questions of the exam.

We'll try to have several level of questions.
